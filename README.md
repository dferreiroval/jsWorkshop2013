Workshop JS 2013 - GsickMinds
=============================

This presentation is an HTML5 customization based on the slides made by google 
for their IO 2012 Conferences (https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/)

To execute them just open slides.html in any browser

Most of the code examples saw in the course are located in the "code_examples" folder.

Enjoy!
